## Machine_Learning

Welcome to the Machine Learning the intent of this repo is to provide a learning environment for 
experimentation with Machine Learning. No prior ML or linear algebra knowledge is expected however
the basics of programming in Python are assumed.

As often as possible new challenges will be added with a seperate readme and notebook/dataset(s)
with increasing complexity and reducing assistance for you to clone and upload your solutions.
This is all with the endstate of building a capability that can be applied to other problems, not
simply achieving the end result of a MBT detector in one fell swoop.
