## Exercise 1

Training an ML classification model from a pre-labelled dataset.  To start, create a new Git branch in this repo and either create a copy of 
the classification notebook with a new name, or work within a Python IDE and copy the code you need to get started.  Push to the repo and highlight issues
within your branch, or ask on the discord for help with errors.

### Aims:
  - To explore basic data loading, manipulation, and visualisation
  - To understand how to pre-process and normalise images
  - To understand the basic Linear Algebra concepts behind numpy
  - To build an initial working image classification model

### Resources
The dataset used can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/code) (but there is no need to download it directly!) and on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/mnist)

The **Classification** notebook in this directory sets up a basic problem, with detailed comments on how and why that was done.  Additionally the 
**Tensorflow** notebook will walk through how to build a simple sequential model and define key terms and hyperparameters to help
you on the first exercise.
